Monte-Carlo Simulation of a Nuclear Reactor


Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate various models of homogeneous reactors, and calculate the dimensions at which criticality is achieved for each model. 

These dimensions were then compared to real world values to determine their suitability with the simulation. 

The simulation was deemed to work best with dilute homogeneous reactors or fast fission reactors with few impurities.
